      "summary": "Thanks to React's component-oriented architecture, the React community has been naturally gravitating towards design systems as a way of standardizing our respective design languages into reusable components. When done successfully, it suddenly becomes trivial to translate standard designs into code. In fact, we may even find that this translation step starts to feel somewhat redundant. In a world of components, how should our design processes change? How should our tooling change? How should we, as React developers, better enable this change? In this talk, we'll look at the current state of design and development, and where we could goâ€”if we're willing to push for it.",
